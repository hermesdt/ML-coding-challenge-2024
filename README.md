## Challenge Overview

**Duration:** 2-4 hours. Please do not spend more time on this. We will have time to dicuss improvements.

**Objective:** Engage with the Kin app, suggest a hypothetical improvement relevant to your position, and implement a solution using mock data and python and pseudocode.

### Part 1: Dog-fooding Kin
1. **Download and Set Up:**
   - Download the Kin app from [mykin.ai](https://mykin.ai).
   - Install and set up the app on your device.

2. **Interaction and Analysis:**
   - Interact with Kin for about 1 hour, exploring its features and understanding how it assists users.
   - Focus particularly on how the app’s advanced memory structure utilizes user data to personalize interactions.

### Part 2: Suggest and Implement an Improvement
1. **Identify an Improvement:**
   - Based on your interaction, identify an area of improvement that could enhance user experience or functionality.

2. **Describe the Improvement:**
   - Document your proposed improvement, explaining its relevance and how it aligns with Kin's goals.

3. **Implementation Outline:**
   - Use python as much as possible but in the inetrest of time you can also use pseudocode to outline your implementation, incorporating mock data to demonstrate how the feature works. It doesn't ahve to run, but it should clearly outline your rationale so we can discuss it on a technical level. Feel free to use an external data source or mock data to highlight the functionality of your idea.

### Part 3: Documentation
- Provide a document including:
  - A summary of your app interaction.
  - A detailed description and rationale for improvement and next steps in the project.
  - Your code and mock data.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Understanding of Kin’s functionalities.
- Creativity and relevance of the improvement.
- Clarity and practicality of the pseudocode.
- Ability to communicate technical concepts in your documentation.

### Interview Follow-Up
In your technical interview, we will discuss:
- Your experience with Kin.
- Your proposed improvement and implementation details.
- Potential modifications if more time were to be available (e.g., a full project).
