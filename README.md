# Description

This repository is an example showing some python code compacting messages on a chat and the corresponding pytest tests.

It contains pre-commit to enforce standard code styles for everyone and a github action to run the tests, to
ensure we don't merge broken code.

# Setup dev environment

```
sh scripts/init.sh
```

# Running tests
